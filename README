== Query builder

This plugin enables you to define finder methods that bypass the overhead
of construct_finder_sql.

  define_finder query_name, query_type, options_hash

creates a SQL query +query_name+ from a given +options+ hash.

supports all options except :include
ignores scope!

class Recipe
  define_finder :find_all_of_user, :all, :conditions => 'user = :user AND priv < :priv'
end

  Recipe.find_all_of_user :user => 'martin', :priv => 1

If options[:positional] is not +nil+ or +false+, the created query method
will use positional paramaters instead of a hash.

Arguments are created in the order of appearance on the parameters passed
to define_finder. Therefore

   define_finder :find_all_of_user, :all,
                 :conditions => 'user = :user AND priv < :priv',
                 :positional => true

will create a query method with parameters +user+ and +priv+, which can be
called like so:

    Recipes.find_all_of_user('martin', 1)
