== Query builder

This plugin enables you to define finder methods that bypass the overhead
of construct_finder_sql.

Inside an ActiveRecord model definition,

  define_finder query_name, query_type, options_hash

will create a SQL query method called +query_name+ from a given
+options_hash+. +query_type+ can be :first or :all.

The plugin supports all options except :include, but ignores
with_scope options.

Example:

  class Recipe
    define_finder :find_all_of_user, :all,
                       :conditions => 'user = :user AND priv < :priv'
  end

This defines a query method which can be called like so:

  Recipe.find_all_of_user :user => 'martin', :priv => 1

This call is equivalent to

  Recipe.find :all, :conditions =>
           ['user = :user AND priv < :priv', {:user => 'martin', :priv => 1}]

If options[:positional] is not +nil+ or +false+, the created query
method will use positional paramaters instead of a hash. In this case,
arguments are created in the order of appearance on the parameters
passed to define_finder. Therefore

   define_finder :find_all_of_user, :all,
                 :conditions => 'user = :user AND priv < :priv',
                 :positional => true

will create a query method with parameters +user+ and +priv+, which can be
called like so:

    Recipes.find_all_of_user('martin', 1)
